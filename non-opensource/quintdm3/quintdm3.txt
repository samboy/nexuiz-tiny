Description : This is the third map of a trilogy composed by other
              two maps called "The Birth Machine" and
"The Guns OF Navarone". What do have these maps
in common? Not only the outhor, obviously, bat there is a theme
that link them each other:
They are all floaters, the first one is in the atmosphere (air),
the second one is above the sea (water), and this one on a desert (earth). Olso, The first one
experiments a vertical way 
to use physics, the second one do that in an horizontal way,
this one in both the way...
and this is the reason why I've choosen the name "wisdom".
The second part of the name "Machine" has been choosen to close
the circle started with "The Birth Machine"
