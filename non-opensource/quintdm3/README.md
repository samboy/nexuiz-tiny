This tiny version of Nexuiz has been using this theme from quintdm3
since 2010.  This song was written by one “Brad” who I am attempting
to contact so we can more fully credit him for this song.  The name of
the song was originally `wisdom.wav`.

The file `quintdm3.txt` describes the permissions.  While the license is
vague, a reasonable person would infer that we can redistribute the
“Wisdom” song as long as it is not commercially sold.
