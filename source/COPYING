The only files which have been altered from the original version
are downer.map and final_rage.map, which use a different name for
sky textures.

Note that the related .bsp files were altered by editing the binary .bsp
files; the maps were *not* rebuilt.  In addition, nexuiz.exe was also
altered to disable connecting to public servers by having the binary
.exe file changed; this is a security fix because a 15-year-old binary
should not be connecting to public Internet servers, and Nexuiz made
the unusual decision to connect to servers whose names were hard coded
in the .exe file.
