This is a single compact skybox which can work in Blood Prison, Soylent, and
Aerowalk.

Right now, this skybox is the default skybox for Soylent.  Unlike the
previous Soylent skybox, this skybox can also be used with Blood Prison
or Soylent without being too much out of place.

This allows us to make a smaller version of nexuiz-tiny where all three
maps use the same skybox.

# Original skybox

To generate the original skybox:

* Go to https://tools.wwwtyro.net/space-3d/index.html
* Select seed `53yb0y2wx69s`
* Select resolution `512`
* Generate skybox

The colors have been altered (to work reasonably well in all three maps), 
and the skybox has been rotated (so the sun is in the right place on the 
Blood Prison map).
