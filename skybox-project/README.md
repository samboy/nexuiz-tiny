This is a single compact skybox which can work in Blood Prison, Soylent, and
Aerowalk.

Right now, this skybox is the default skybox for Soylent.  Unlike the
previous Soylent skybox, this skybox can also be used with Blood Prison
or Aerowalk without being too much out of place.

This allows us to make a smaller version of nexuiz-tiny where all three
maps use the same skybox.

The internal name of the skybox in nexuiz-tiny is `env/space/s`

# Original skybox

To generate the original skybox:

* Go to https://tools.wwwtyro.net/space-3d/index.html or to index.html
  in this directory.
* Select seed `3d7za2x8311c`
* Generate skybox

The skybox has been rotated so the sun (moon?) is in roughly the right 
place on the Blood Prison map.
