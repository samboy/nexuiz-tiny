# Goal

Make a single compact skybox which can work in Blood Prison, Soylent, and
Aerowalk.

# Progress

We have a skybox which works, but there are issues because 8-bit color
images were fairly extensively edited.

# Original skybox

To generate the original skybox:

* Go to https://tools.wwwtyro.net/space-3d/
* Select seed `53yb0y2wx69s`
* Select resolution `512`
* Generate skybox

The colors have been altered (to work reasonably well in all three maps), 
and the skybox has been rotated (so the sun is in the right place in the 
Blood Prison map).
