This is a single compact skybox which is used in Blood Prison, Soylent, and
Aerowalk.

This allows us to make a smaller version of nexuiz-tiny where all three
maps use the same skybox.

The internal name of the skybox in nexuiz-tiny is `env/space/s`

# Original skybox

To generate the original skybox:

* Go to https://tools.wwwtyro.net/space-3d/index.html or to index.html
  in this directory.
* Select seed `3d7za2x8311c`
* Generate skybox

The skybox has been rotated so the sun (moon?) is in roughly the right 
place on the Blood Prison map.
