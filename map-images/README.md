These are images for the maps, now that the skyboxes have changed on
all of them (except Downer, whose screen shot we will keep)

The secret console commands to remove the weapon and HUD in these
screenshots:

```
r_drawviewmodel 0
r_letterbox -1
sv_cheats 1
map ${NAME}
fly
```

Where ${NAME} is one of `aerowalk_nextiny`, `bloodprison`, `final_rage`,
`graphite`, `soylent`, or `toxic`.
