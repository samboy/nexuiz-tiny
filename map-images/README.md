These are images for the maps, now that the skyboxes have changed on
all of them (except Downer, whose screen shot we will keep)

The secret console commands to remove the weapon and HUD in these
screenshots:

```
r_drawviewmodel 0
r_letterbox -1
sv_cheats 1
map ${NAME}
fly
```

Where ${NAME} is one of `aerowalk_nextiny`, `bloodprison`, `final_rage`,
`graphite`, `soylent`, or `toxic`.

Use F12 to take the screenshot.

The screenshots are too dark; I open them up in Gimp to make them
brighter (brightness 75, contrast 50 for all except the Graphite
screenshot).
