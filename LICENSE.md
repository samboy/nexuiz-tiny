As per Xonoticâ€™s license, most of the data here is licensed under 
both version 2 and any later version of the GPL.  As per the
[GNU FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#v2v3Compatibility),
this allows the data to be freely redistributed.

Some of the data (read: *not* code) is GPLv3 licensed; it is my 
understanding that a GPLv2+ licensed program can load GPLv3 licensed 
data.  This data is in the folder `GPLv3-data/` and generates a
separate `GPLv3-data.pak3` file.

Some of the other data is distributed under terms which are different
from the GPL (free distribution over the Internet is allowed, but 
selling the data on a CD-rom is not allowed).  Again, a GPLv2+ 
licensed program can load this data without the license being
violated.  This data is in a separate directory, `non-opensource/`,
and the resulting generated file has the name `aerowalk-notOpenSource.pk3`.
