Bugfix release:

    * Up to date changelog
    * Remove blaster-jump-armor start from Aerowalk, since bots at some
      skill levels gets stuck here
    * Update map descriptions to have accurate weapon lists: All maps now
      have all weapons

2022-01-10 changes

Update game rules for 2022:

    * Health regeneration disabled
    * Max health and armor capped at 250
    * Rocket launcher made less powerful
    * Campaign is now a harder 21-map instead of an easy five-map campaign
    * All maps now have all weapons
    * One Mega armor moved in Blood Prison so bot has access to both MAs
    * Rocket/blaster jump only mega armors in Aerowalk and Graphite now
      are double mega-armors to make blaster jump worthwhile

Aesthetic changes:

    * Downer map now uses its original skybox
    * Final Rage map now uses the same sky as Downer
    * Toxic now uses the sunset "heaven" sky used by Graphite

2020-05-17 changes

* Disable connecting to servers on the Internet, which will not be
  compatible with this version of Nexuiz.  LAN party playing is
  still possible.

2020-05-16 changes

* Toxic and Blood Prison music themes are now in their own .pk3 files.
  Both maps will use other music when the .pk3 files are removed.  This
  allows one to easily make a version of nexuiz-tiny which fits in under
  48 mebibytes, by simply reducing the number of songs included.

2020-05-07 changes

* Fix two missing textures in Toxic map

2020-05-06 changes

* Aerowalk map: Fix issue with missing ammo; rename aerowalk_nextiny
* Graphite map: Fix issue with missing medium healths

2020-04-30-AeroFix changes

* Aerowalk map: Fix issue with lights missing a texture

2020-04-30 changes

* Add support for 1024x600, 1280x720, and 1366x768 resolutions
* Add shell script which generates Nexuiz packages for graphite_b2
* Skybox fixes to make it easier to package Graphite map
* Add Makefile.nocompress to make uncompressed .pk3 files (which compress
  better in 7-zip)
* Aerowalk map: Use space music used for the Soylent map
* Correctly attribute track001.ogg soundtrack (intro, Final Rage)
* Downer map: Use Nexuiz 1.1 version of map (Reduces Intel 620 buggy driver
  flicker issue)
* Downer map: Change skybox name in downer.bsp file (1-character change)
* Downer map: Update music

2020-04-29 changes

* Soylent map: Fix lights 
* Convert Graphite map from Xonotic in to Nexuiz format and add it
  to nexuiz-tiny
* Replace Aggressor map with Downer map.  I never liked the Aggressor map,
  feeling it was too claustrophobic.  I only added it to the 2010 Netbook 
  remix of Nexuiz because it was small and had official 2-player support.  
  Downer, while officially needing three or more players, is perfectly 
  playable as a 2-player deathmatch map, and has always been part of 
  Nexuiz.

2020-04-28 changes

* Add Aerowalk map to nexuiz-tiny.  While this is not an open source map,
  it is a classic map which I played countless times with a buddy of mine
  back in the day.  This is a well-liked map, which has been remade a
  number of times.
* Add tool to help track which textures a given map uses

2020-04-20 changes

* Convert nexuiz-tiny in to a GitHub repo
* Add Soylent map to the list of available maps
* Make the campaign playable

2011 release

* Nexuiz tiny netbook: Make a Netbook compatible version of Nexuiz.
  Remove all but one or two models; have only four maps: Aggressor,
  Blood Prison, Final Rage, and Toxic.  Use Nexuiz 2.3 which has
  better Netbook performance.
