# z_allweapons.pk3

If you put this in the `data/` folder, all of the maps will have all
weapons available.

Note that this file is incompatible with `z_nohealth.pk3`, 
`z_norocketlauncher.pk3`, and `z_noRLnohealth.pk3`.

# z_newcampaign.pk3

This replaces the basic, easy five-map campaign with a 21-map more 
challenging campaign.  Each map is a 1-on-1 battle, and all seven
maps are played three times each, with the bots getting harder as
you advance in the campaign.

# z_nohealth.pk3

If you put this in the `data/` folder, all of the maps will have no 
health on them.  By combining this with a `Health regeneration speed` 
of 0.00, it makes games more balanced by allowing a weaker player
to have any damage they do against a stronger player be present until
the stronger player gets fragged.

To adjust `Health regeneration speed`:

* Create → Game Settings → Misc
* Scroll down
* Put the mouse over `Health regeneration speed`
* Use the arrow keys and keyboard to type in `0.00`

Note that this file is incompatible with `z_allweapons.pk3`, 
`z_norocketlauncher.pk3`, and `z_noRLnohealth.pk3`.

# z_norocketlauncher.pk3

The rocket launcher may be over powered in Nexuiz.  That in mind,
this file eliminates the rocket launcher from all maps.

If you put this in the `data/` folder, all of the maps will have all
weapons *except the rocket launcher* available.

Note that this file is incompatible with `z_allweapons.pk3`, 
`z_nohealth.pk3`, and `z_noRLnohealth.pk3`.

# z_noRLnohealth.pk3

This is a version of the “no rocket launcher” mod, but, in addition, all
health has been replaced with additional ammunition.

By combining this with a `Health regeneration speed` of 0.00, it makes
games more balanced by allowing a weaker player to have any damage they
do against a stronger player be present until the stronger player gets
fragged.  

See above for notes on how to adjust `Health regeneration speed`.

Note that this file is incompatible with `z_allweapons.pk3`,
`z_norocketlauncher.pk3`, and `z_nohealth.pk3`.
