# z_allweapons.pk3

If you put this in the `data/` folder, all of the maps will have all
weapons available.

Note that this file is incompatible with `z_nohealth.pk3`.

# z_newcampaign.pk3

This replaces the basic, easy five-map campaign with a 21-map more 
challenging campaign.  Each map is a 1-on-1 battle, and all seven
maps are played three times each, with the bots getting harder as
you advance in the campaign.

# z_nohealth.pk3

If you put this in the `data/` folder, all of the maps will have no 
health on them.  By combining this with a `Health regeneration speed` 
of 0.00, it makes games more balanced by allowing a weaker player
to have any damage they do against a stronger player be present until
the stronger player gets fragged.

To adjust `Health regeneration speed`:

* Create → Game Settings → Misc
* Scroll down
* Put the mouse over `Health regeneration speed`
* Use the arrow keys and keyboard to type in `0.00`

Note that this file is incompatible with `z_allweapons.pk3`.
